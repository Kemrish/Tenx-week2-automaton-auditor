## Criterion Breakdown

### forensic_accuracy_code
**Score:** 4/5

**Narrative:**
Final Score 4/5 with variance 2.0. Prosecution emphasized: The evidence indicates that while Pydantic State models are present and a tool registry exists, the implementation falls short of production-grade engineering standards. The use of 'os.system' for tool execution without  Defense emphasized: The submission demonstrates a commendable effort in integrating complex regex and Tree-Sitter for parsing code structures, showcasing a creative workaround to environment limitations. This indicates a deep understanding  Tech Lead emphasized: The repository demonstrates a strong foundation in production-grade engineering practices, particularly in the use of Pydantic for state models, which ensures type safety and validation. The tool registry appears dynamic

### forensic_accuracy_docs
**Score:** 4/5

**Narrative:**
Final Score 4/5 with variance 3.0. Prosecution emphasized: The documentation claims the implementation of advanced features such as 'Vision analysis' which are conspicuously absent in the actual codebase. This discrepancy indicates a significant gap between the documented capabi Defense emphasized: The documentation, while not perfectly aligning with the codebase in every aspect, demonstrates a commendable effort in theoretical understanding and application of concepts such as 'Cognitive Debt' and 'Trust Debt'. The Tech Lead emphasized: The documentation provides a solid theoretical foundation, referencing key concepts such as 'Cognitive Debt' and 'Trust Debt', which shows a deep understanding of the subject matter. However, there's a slight mismatch be

### langgraph_architecture
**Score:** 5/5

**Narrative:**
Final Score 5/5 with variance 3.0. Prosecution emphasized: Despite the evidence indicating a structure that supports fan-out, fan-in, and conditional logic, the mere presence of these features does not guarantee 'Orchestration Rigor'. The claim of a sophisticated orchestration i Defense emphasized: The submission demonstrates a commendable effort in implementing a complex LangGraph architecture with features such as fan-out, fan-in, conditional edges, and a checkpointer for state persistence and recovery. This indi Tech Lead emphasized: The LangGraph architecture demonstrates a high level of orchestration rigor, incorporating both fan-out and fan-in patterns, alongside conditional edges to handle various scenarios such as 'Evidence Missing' or 'Node Fai

**Dissent:** Prosecution: Score 2 - Despite the evidence indicating a structure that supports fan-out, fan-in, and conditional logic, the mere presence of these features does not guarantee 'Orches
