- ❌ judicial_nuance: Critical issues
- ❌ langgraph_architecture: Critical issues
- ❌ visual_fidelity: Critical issues


## Criterion Breakdown

### forensic_accuracy_code
**Score:** 1/5

**Dissent:** Prosecution: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: ### Verdict: Forensic Accuracy (Codebase)

#### Score: 1

Final Ruling: Score 1

**Remediation:**
- Critical: Judgment failed: Invalid json output: ### Verdict: Forensic Accuracy (Codebase)

#### Score: 1

#### Argument:
The evidence presented for the Forensic Accuracy (Codebase) dimension falls significantly
- Implement: Execute Protocol A.1: Trace the repository for production-grade engineering. Verify Pydantic State models in 'src/graph.py' or 'src/state.py'. Check 'src/tools/' for functionally registered 'git' and 'ast' tools. Check for temporary directory sandboxing during 'git clone'.

### forensic_accuracy_docs
**Score:** 1/5

**Dissent:** Prosecution: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The defendant's documentation, as presente

Defense: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 3

Argument:

Final Ruling: Score 1

**Remediation:**
- Critical: Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The defendant's documentation, as presented in the PDF report, fails to meet the required standards for forensic accuracy in documentation. Th
- Implement: Execute Protocol A.2: Scan PDF for theoretical depth. Verify mentions of 'Cognitive Debt' and 'Trust Debt'. Cross-reference claims made in the PDF (e.g., 'We implemented parallel nodes') with the evidence found by the Code Detective.

### judicial_nuance
**Score:** 1/5

**Dissent:** Prosecution: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The defendant's implementation of the Judi

Defense: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: ### Defense Case for Judicial Nuance & Dialectics

#### Score:

Tech Lead: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 2

Argument: The criterion for Judicial Nuance & Dialec

Final Ruling: Score 1

**Remediation:**
- Critical: Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The defendant's implementation of the Judicial Nuance & Dialectics criterion exhibits a glaring lack of differentiation among the Prosecutor, 
- Implement: Scan 'src/nodes/' or prompt templates. Verify that Prosecutor, Defense, and Tech Lead personas have distinct, conflicting system prompts. Check if the graph actually runs these nodes in parallel.

### langgraph_architecture
**Score:** 1/5

**Dissent:** Prosecution: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The evidence presented for the LangGraph O

Defense: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: ### Defense Case for LangGraph Orchestration Rigor

#### Score

Tech Lead: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The LangGraph Orchestration Rigor assessme

Final Ruling: Score 1

**Remediation:**
- Critical: Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The evidence presented for the LangGraph Orchestration Rigor criterion falls significantly short of demonstrating a robust, or even adequate, 
- Implement: Analyze the StateGraph definition. Verify the use of parallel branches (fan-out) for Judges and Detectives. Check for conditional edges that handle 'Evidence Missing' or 'Node Failure' scenarios.

### visual_fidelity
**Score:** 1/5

**Dissent:** Prosecution: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The Visual Swarm Blueprint dimension deman

Defense: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 2

Argument:

Tech Lead: Score 1 - Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The Visual Swarm Blueprint, as described i

Final Ruling: Score 1

**Remediation:**
- Critical: Judgment failed: Invalid json output: Score: 1

Argument: The Visual Swarm Blueprint dimension demands a high level of detail and accuracy in the representation of the system's architecture and operat
- Implement: Execute Protocol A.3: Analyze diagrams. Verify if the visual flow matches the LangGraph code. Check for 'Reasoning Loop' visualization (Agent -> Hook -> Context).
